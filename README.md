# Is it a dog or a cat?
This project aims to create a program that can look at a image and tell if there's a dog or a cat on the picture.

It's written in **Python 3.6**, and it uses **TensorFlow** to create, train and execute the model. **OpenCV2** to do image operations and **numpy** to do multidimensional array operations.

For the training set, it uses `Kaggle Cats and Dogs Dataset` that is freely avaliable for download by Microsoft. It consist of 1250 photos of dogs and 1250 photos of cats all in the `.jpg` format.
